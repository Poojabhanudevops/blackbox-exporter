# Blackbox Exporter Overview

## What is the Blackbox Exporter?

The **Blackbox Exporter** is a Prometheus exporter used to probe external endpoints or services. It does **not collect metrics from inside an application**—instead, it checks from the outside whether a service responds.

---

## What Can It Probe?

- **HTTP(S) endpoints** (websites, APIs)
- **TCP endpoints**
- **ICMP (ping)**
- **DNS queries**

---

## Example

Blackbox Exporter might probe your URL `https://grafana.k8s.opstree.dev` every 30 seconds:

- If it receives an HTTP 200 response → reported as **UP**
- If it cannot connect or gets an error response → reported as **DOWN**

---

## Why Use Blackbox Exporter?

✅ **Platform-agnostic**

- Can monitor any endpoint — cloud, on-premises, VMs, containers.

✅ **Simple external monitoring**

- Useful as a “heartbeat” check to confirm services are reachable.

---

## Limitations of Blackbox Exporter

### Limitation 1 – Surface-Level Checks Only

Blackbox Exporter merely checks:

- Whether a port is open
- Whether an HTTP response is received
- The HTTP status code (200, 500, etc.)
- The response time (probe duration)

It **cannot verify business functionality.**

#### Example

> “If a user tries to log in and cannot, how would we detect that on the SLA dashboard?”

- Blackbox Exporter only checks whether the login page loads.
- If the page loads and returns HTTP 200 → reported as **UP**
- But if a user enters credentials and login fails → Blackbox has no way to detect this failure.

---

## Limitation 2 – Blind to Business Logic

Consider the following login API response:

```
{
"success": false,
"error": "Invalid credentials"
}
```

HTTP 200 is returned, so Blackbox will report it as **UP**.  

But the **real SLA is impacted** — users cannot log in.  

→ Blackbox monitors **infrastructure-level availability**, not business-level functionality.

---

## How to Measure SLA/SLO Properly?

Blackbox alone cannot fully cover SLA/SLO monitoring where business logic is involved.

| Feature                                       | Blackbox Exporter |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Checks availability                           | ✅                |
| Checks response time                          | ✅                |
| Validates business logic (e.g. login success) | ❌                |
| Tests multi-step workflows                    | ❌                |
| Provides tracing & root cause insights        | ❌                |
| Measures real user experience                 | ❌                |

## Conclusion

The Blackbox Exporter is great for monitoring **infrastructure-level availability** but is insufficient for measuring **functional SLAs** like login success.
